Welcome to Mad Scientist Hacks — a personal stash of useful code fragments, small utilities, and quick-and-dirty scripts developed to survive the chaos of the experimental lab.



## 🙋‍♂️ Who Is This For?

* New lab members who don't know where to start with some more advanced topics

* Tired postdocs trying to remember how they fixed that one bug in 2023

* Future-you, hoping past-you left useful comments (past-you tried!)
